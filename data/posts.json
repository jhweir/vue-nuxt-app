        "description": "When the LIGO collaboration first detected the spacetime ripples of a gravitational wave it came from the merger of two black holes. To date, scientists have detected at least ten pairs of black holes spiraling into and combining with each other. But there’s still an outstanding mystery about these singularities: why are some of them so big? Some have been far larger than scientists think possible for a black hole created in the aftermath of a star’s death. Now, a group of researchers has proposed a new possibility. Black holes in the accretion disk surrounding a galaxy’s central supermassive black hole might gather in similar orbits. This could lead black holes to go through multiple mergers, growing larger each time.",
